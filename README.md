# PandaAC

## Description

PandaAC is a drop-in mod for preventing certain cheats. Hacks become much harder to use, and certain exploits are patched. 
The anticheat works by trying to prevent hacks from happening, rather than automatically kicking/banning. 
This mod is heavily WIP, and should not really be used on a production server.
